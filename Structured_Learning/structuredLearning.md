### Upcoming Structured Learning

Prior to the event we will provide each group tailored learning options. This often includes lists of demonstrations and workshops each team can evaluate and select the ones they would like the Oracle engineers to show or work with them on before the event. Our goal with structured learning is to provide a baseline familiarity with any technology you may use at the event.

_Structured Learning is tailored to the use case requirements for each group. It is a required element for each group member to attend. Each learning session is open to any other group or group member to attend if they so choose._
