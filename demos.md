 Automating invoice processing helps to save a serious amount of time and money compared with manual paper invoice processing, creating efficiencies and increasing the accuracy of captured data.  Validate your invoices and check your invoice data against data files e.g. supplier name, amount and purchase order number.  It also reduces your reliance on paper forms, faxes, and documents. It enables you to take advantage of dynamic discounting, eliminate late-payment fees, and improve throughput.
